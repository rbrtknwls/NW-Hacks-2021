We built a "socially good" social network, which rewards people based on the positive impact they have on the people around them. Positive being defined by:

1) Sentiment Anaylisis of there messages using NLP
2) Feedback from others (stars during conversations)
3) Analyitics on the types of conversations and people interacted with
